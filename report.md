### Part 1

Create a scatter plot of the training set of the linearly_separable example in the tests section. Use different colors or symbols for the two classes. Draw the line that the perceptron algorithm found. Include the mathematical equation of the line in your report.
### Part 2

Write an analysis of training the ANN with different parameters. Include an image of the network, the parameters used, and the error and time it took to train each network. Write a brief reflection about what you think is happening in the different ANNs, and why the ANN is behaving like it is. How did the choice of parameters influence the behavior of the ANN?

Other interesting aspects you could include in your reflection are:

    Explanations as to what are ANNs good for.
    Where would you use them?
    Are they worth the effort implementing or not?
    What kinds of problems do they not solve?
